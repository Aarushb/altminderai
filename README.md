### Getting started
#### Create an Issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.
#### Solve an issue

Scan through our issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, I donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
